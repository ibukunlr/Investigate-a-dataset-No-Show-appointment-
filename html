Table of Contents Introduction Data Wrangling Exploratory Data Analysis Conclusions

Introduction
The dataset(No-show-appointments) used in this report was originally gotten from Kaggle and it collects the information of over 100k medical appointments in Brazil. I will be comunicating my findings as to why a patient decides to show up or not. In this dataset, there are 110527 enteries and 14 columns:

Patient Id : The unique id of the patient.

Appointment Id : The unique identification of appointment for the patient.

Gender : The sex of the patient

ScheduledDay: The date scheduled for the medical appointment

AppointmentDay : The day the patient shows up for the appointment.

Age: The age of the patient

Neighbourhood: The neighbourhood of the hospital of appointment.

Scholarship: This explains whether a patient enrolled in the brazillian welfare program called Bolsa Familia or not. There are 2 unique values (0 & 1) in this column. 0 signifies that patient did not enroll for the welfare scheme while 1 means the patient is under the welfare scheme.

Hipertension : This column explains whether a patient is hypertensive or not.

Diabetes: This column has (0 & 1) as unique values, 0 means the patient is not diabetic and 1 indicates that the patient is .

Alcoholism: Is the patient an alcoholic or not.

Handcap: Is the patient disabled or not.

SMS_received: Was the patient notified of the appointment prior to the date.

No-Show : This column explains if the patient actually shows up for the appointment or not. Response Yes indicates that the patient did not show up while No means the patient showed up.

Questions :

1) Is scholarship a determinant factor as to why the patient decides to show up or not ? 2) Does receiving an sms notification determines if the patient shows up or not ? 3) Does being an alcoholic determines if a patient will keep to his appointment?

The statiscal summary shows the mean age range of the patients is 37 years of age. The least is -1, which is an abnormality as we cant have age in (-). I will be fixing this and also drop some columns (Hipertension, diabetes, Neighbourhood and handcap) as I do not need them for my final analysis.

#Check for the abnormal age.

negative_age = df[df.Age<0]

Exploratory Data Analysis
#Crearting a mask for patients that showed up and those that didnt show up.
Show_up = df.No_show == 'No'
not_show_up = df.No_show == 'Yes'
#A function to avoid repetitive code 
def hist_plot(column, xlabel, ylabel, color, title, condition):
    df[column][condition].hist(color=color)
    plt.title(title, fontsize=16, weight='bold')
    plt.xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=16, weight='bold')
    plt.ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=16, weight='bold')
    
    
hist_plot('Age', 'Age', 'Count of Records', 'blue', 'Age Distribution of available patients', Show_up)

hist_plot('Age', 'Age', 'Count of Records', 'orange', 'Age Distribution of non-available patients', not_show_up)

The distribution of age is right skewed for both available and non available patients, with the majority of them within the ages of 0-40

Research Question 1 (Is scholarship a determinant factor as to why the patient decides to show up or not ?)
#Analysing Scholarship as a determinant factor
df['No_show'].groupby(df['Scholarship']).value_counts(normalize=True).unstack('No_show').plot(kind='bar',rot=0,width=0.8, figsize=(12,6))
plt.title("Available/Not Available for {}".format('Scholarship').title(), fontsize = 16, weight = "bold")
plt.xlabel('Scholarship',fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel("Occurrence",fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
Text(0, 0.5, 'Occurrence')

Over 80% of patients that didnt enroll for the welfare scheme by the government showed up for their appointment. Also, about 80% of those that were awarded schlorship also showed up for their appointment.

20% of patients that didnt enroll showed up for their appoinment while over 20% of enrollee did not show up

Research Question 2 (Does receiving an sms notification determines if a patient shows up or not ?)
#Analysing SMS_received as a determinant factor
df['No_show'].groupby(df['SMS_received']).value_counts(normalize=True).unstack('No_show').plot(kind='bar',rot=0,width=0.8, figsize=(12,6))
plt.title("Available/Not Available for {}".format('SMS_received').title(), fontsize = 16, weight = "bold")
plt.xlabel('SMS_received',fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel("Occurrence",fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
Text(0, 0.5, 'Occurrence')

More than 80% of patients that did not receive SMS notification showed up for their appointment while about 20% did not show up.

On the other hand, about 75% of patients that received SMS did show up, and about 30% did not.

Research Question 3 (Does being an alcoholic determines if a patient will keep to his appointment or not?)
#Analysing Alcoholism as a determinant factor
df['No_show'].groupby(df['Alcoholism']).value_counts(normalize=True).unstack('No_show').plot(kind='bar',rot=0,width=0.8, figsize=(12,6))
plt.title("Available/Not Available for {}".format('Alcoholism').title(), fontsize = 16, weight = "bold")
plt.xlabel('Alcoholism',fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
plt.ylabel("Occurrence",fontsize = 13,weight = 'bold')
Text(0, 0.5, 'Occurrence')

80% of both alcholics and non alcholics showed up for their appointment and about 20% of both did not.

Conclusions
From the explanatory analysis , it is clear that none of the questions I raised at the begining determines why a patient failed to show up for his or her appointment.

The percentage of people showing up and those that did not based on the factors I listed are pretty close.

There are definitely other reasons why the patients couldnt make it. The hospital might be too far or they had other pressing engagement.

It's also worthy of note that 80% of patients struggling with alcoholism still showed up for their appointment.

Limitations
One of the limitations I had in my analysis is lack of detailed information. For instance, for the patients that didnt show up but received sms, we cant fully ascertain when the messages were sent out . The timing could have been part of the reasons they couldnt show up for their appointments.
